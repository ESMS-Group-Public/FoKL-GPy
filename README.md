## About FoKL

FoKL-GPy, or FoKL, is a Python package intended for use in machine learning. The name comes from a unique implementation 
of **Fo**rward variable selection using **K**arhunen-**L**o√®ve decomposed **G**aussian **P**rocesses (GP's) in 
**Py**thon (i.e., **FoKL-GPy**). 

The primary advantages of FoKL are:
- Fast inference on static and dynamic datasets using scalable GP regression
- Significant accuracy retained despite being fast

Some other advantages of FoKL include:
- Export modeled non-linear dynamics as a symbolic equation
- Take first and second derivatives of model with respect to any input variable (e.g., gradient)
- Multiple kernels available (BSS-ANOVA, Bernoulli Polynomials)
- Automatic normalization and formatting of dataset
- Automatically split specified fraction of dataset into a training set and retain the rest for testing
- Easy adjusting of hyperparameters for sweeping through variations in order to find optimal settings
- Ability to save, share, and load models
- Ability to evaluate a model without known data

To read more about FoKL, please see the [Benchmarks and Papers](#benchmarks-and-papers) section.

## Installation and Setup

FoKL is available through PyPI:

```cmd
pip install FoKL
```

Alternatively, the GitHub repository may be cloned to create a local copy in which the examples and documentation will 
be included:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ESMS-Group-Public/FoKL-GPy
```

Once installed, import the FoKL module into your environment with:

```
from FoKL import FoKLRoutines
```

If loading a pre-existing FoKL class object:

```
model = FoKLRoutines.load('filename_of_model')

# Or, if your pre-existing model is in a different folder than your Python script:
model = FoKLRoutines.load('filename_of_model', 'directory_of_model')
```

Else if creating a new FoKL class object:
```
model = FoKLRoutines.FoKL()
```

Now you may call methods on the class and reference its attributes. For help with this, please see [Use Cases](#use-cases).

## Use Cases

Please first refer to the following for tutorials and examples:
- [Training and/or evaluating a model](docs/tutorials/clean.py)

### FoKLRoutines.load

```
self = FoKLRoutines.load(filename, directory=None)
```

Load a FoKL class from a file.

By default, *directory* is the current working directory that contains the script calling this method. An absolute or 
relative directory may be defined if the model to load is located elsewhere.

For simplicity, enter the returned output from *self.save()* as the argument here, i.e., for *filename*. Do this while 
leaving *directory* blank since *filename* can simply include the directory itself.

### FoKLRoutines.FoKL

```
self = FoKLRoutines.FoKL(**kwargs)
```

This creates a class object that contains all information relevant to and defining a FoKL model.

Upon initialization, hyperparameters and some other settings are defined with default values as attributes of the FoKL 
class. These attributes are as follows, and any or all may be specified as a keyword or later updated by redefining the 
a class attribute.

Each method has optional inputs that allow for flexibility in how FoKL is used so that you may leverage these methods 
for your specific requirements. Please refer to the [Use Cases](#use-cases) first, then explore the following documentation of 
each method as needed.

#### clean

```
self.clean(self, inputs, data=None, **kwargs)
```

For cleaning and formatting inputs prior to training a FoKL model. Note that data is not required but should be entered 
if available; otherwise, leave blank.

| Input    | Type | Description                                                                                              | Default |
|----------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| *inputs* | any  | NxM matrix of N experimental measurements, i.e., independent *x* variables for training *f(x1, ..., xM)* | n/a     |
| *data*   | any  | Nx1 vector of N experimental results, i.e., dependent *y* variable where <br/>*y = f(x1, ..., xM)*       | *None*  |

| Keyword                | Type   | Description                                  | Default  |
|------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
| *train*                | scalar | fraction of N datapoints to use for training | 1        |

Other keywords are in development to enable alternate routines of splitting the dataset into test and train sets according to the percentage set by *train*, but currently the split is performed randomly. Also in development are automatic outlier detection and removal routines.

After calling *clean*, several new attributes get defined for the FoKL class. The following is a full list but often only *self.inputs* and *self.data* are needed; however, *self.traininputs* and *self.traindata* as well as the numpy versions *self.inputs_np* and *self.traininputs_np* can be useful. Be sure to use these attributes in place of the original dataset entered as *inputs* and *data* so that normalization and formatting errors are avoided.

| *dy*   | numpy  | derivative of model with respect to input variable(s) (i.e., state(s)) defined by *d1* and *d2* | gradient |

Tip:
- To turn off all first-derivatives, set *d1=False* instead of *d1=0*. The reason is *d1* and *d2*, if set to an integer,
 will return the derivative with respect to the input variable indexed by that integer using Python indexing.
 In other words, for a two-input FoKL model, setting *d1=1* and *d2=0* will return the first-derivative with
 respect to the second input (*d1=1*) and the second-derivative with respect to the first input (*d2=0*).
 Alternatively, *d1=[False, True]* and *d2=[True, False]* will function the same so that boolean lists may be used in cases where the derivative with respect to more than one state, but not all states, is required.

#### evaluate_basis

```
basis = self.evaluate_basis(self, c, x, kernel=None, d=0)
```

Evaluate a basis function at a single point by providing coefficients, *x* value(s), and (optionally) the kernel. This method is primarily used internally by other methods and so is not expected to be used by the user, but is available for testing purposes and to provide insight toward how the basis functions get evaluated in the *evaluate* method.

For evaluating a FoKL model, see [*evaluate*](#evaluate).

#### evaluate

```

| Output  | Type  | Description                                                                        |
|---------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *meen*  | numpy | model predictions for provided *inputs* (i.e., *y* where *y = f(x0, x1, ..., xM)*) |

Note if attempting to automatically format *inputs* but normalize to different [min, max] values than those of *inputs*, this will have to be done manually. A work around to achieve this is as follows:

```
# Un-normalized and un-formatted 'raw' input variables of dataset:
x = [x0, x1, ..., xM]

# Initialize FoKL class:
f = FoKLRoutines.FoKL(...)

# Automatically normalize and format:
f.clean(x)

# Normalized and formatted 'raw' input variables of dataset:
x = f.inputs_np

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Un-normalized and un-formatted 'other' input variables to evaluate:
u = [u0, u1, ..., uM]

# Initialize additional "throw-away" FoKL class in order to access clean without overriding attributes:
dummy = FoKLRoutines.FoKL(...)

# Automatically normalize and format:
dummy.clean(u)

# Normalized and formatted 'other' input variables to evaluate:
u = dummy.inputs_np

# Both x and u are normalized to 0-1 scales, but we need to re-scale u according to x:
u = u * (dummy.normalize[1] - dummy.normalize[0]) + dummy.normalize[0]  # scale of original u
u = (u - f.normalize[0]) / (f.normalize[1] - f.normalize[0])  # scale of normalized x

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Both x and u are on the same scale now, normalized according to x, and so long as u is contained within x's extrema:
meen = f.evaluate(u)
```

The following will ***NOT*** achieve the same results:
```
meen != f.evaluate(u, clean=True)
meen != f.evaluate(u, clean=True, normalize=f.normalize)
```

However, if attempting to ***ONLY*** normalize *inputs* to different [min, max] values, implying the format of *inputs* matches exactly with the format of *inputs_np* returned by *clean* (that is, NxM numpy matrix), then the following will indeed achieve the same results:
```
meen = f.evaluate(u, normalize=f.normalize)
```

#### coverage3

```
meen, bounds, rmse = self.coverage3(self, **kwargs)
```

For validation testing of a FoKL model. Default functionality is to evaluate all inputs (i.e., train and test sets) using *evaluate*.
Returned is the predicted output *meen*, confidence bounds *bounds*, and Root Mean Square Error *rmse*. A plot
may be returned by setting *plot=True*; or, for a potentially more meaningful plot in terms of judging
accuracy, *plot='sorted'* will plot the data in increasing value.

#### clear

```
self.clear(self, keep=None, clear=None, all=False)
```

Delete all attributes from the FoKL class except for hyperparameters and settings, unless otherwise specified by the *clear* keyword.
If an attribute is listed in both the *clear* and *keep* keywords, then the attribute is cleared.

| Input   | Type            | Description                                                                                       | Default     |

| *all*   | boolean         | if *True* then all attributes (including hyperparameters) get deleted regardless                  | *False*     |

Note when the FoKL class was initialized, the names of the hyperparameters and settings which got defined as attributes were stored in a list of strings. This list of strings was defined as *self.keep* when the class was initialized, which here preserves those attributes by default. See documentation for [*FoKLRoutines.FoKL*](#foklroutinesfokl) to see a list of these attributes (i.e., hyperparameters and settings).

To remove all attributes from the class, simply call:
```
self.clear(all=True)
```

#### to_pyomo

```
m = self.to_pyomo(self, m=None, y=None, x=None, ReturnObjective=False)
```

Automatically convert a FoKL model trained with or defined by the 'Bernoulli Polynomials' kernel to a symbolic expression of a Pyomo model. By default, the symbolic FoKL expression is defined as a Pyomo constraint; however, it may be defined as the Pyomo model's objective with *ReturnObjective=True*.

#### save

```
filepath = self.save(self, filename=None, directory=None)
```

Save a FoKL class as a file. By default, *filename* is of the form 'model_yyyymmddhhmmss.fokl' and is saved to the
directory of the Python script calling this method. Use *directory* to change the directory saved to, or simply
embed the directory manually within *filename*. Note that the directory must exist prior to calling this method.

Returned is *filepath*. Enter this as the argument to [*load*](#foklroutinesload) to later reload the model. Explicitly, that is:
```
FoKLRoutines.load(filepath)  # == FoKLRoutines.load(filename, directory)
```

| *h*           | *h* is the step size with respect to time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| *used_inputs* | *used_inputs* is a list of arrays containing the information as to what inputs are used in what model. Each array should contain a vector corresponding to a different model. Inputs should be referred to as those being integrated first, followed by those contained in b (in the same order as they appear in y0 and b respectively).                                        |

| Output | Description                                                                                |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *T*    | *T* is an array of the time steps the models are integrated at.                            |
| *Y*    | *Y* is an array of the models that have been integrated, at the time steps contained in T. |

For example, if two models were being integrated, with 3 other inputs total
and the 1st model used both models outputs as inputs and the 1st and 3rd additional
inputs, while the 2nd model used its own output as an input and the 2nd
and 3rd additional inputs,
```
used_inputs = [[1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]]
```
If the models created do not follow this ordering scheme for their inputs,
the inputs can be rearranged based upon an alternate
numbering scheme provided to *used_inputs*. E.g., if the inputs need to be reordered then the 1st input should have a '1' in its place in the
*used_inputs* vector, the 2nd input should have a '2' and so on. Using the
same example as before, if the 1st models inputs needed rearranged so that
the 3rd additional input came first, followed by the two model outputs in
the same order as they are in *y0*, and ends with the 1st additional input,
then the 1st cell in *used_inputs* would have the form [2, 3, 4, 0, 1].

## Benchmarks and Papers

As mentioned in [About FoKL](#about-fokl), the primary advantage offered by FoKL in comparison to other machine learning packages 
is a significant decrease in computation time for training a model while not experiencing a significant decrease in 
accuracy. This holds true for most datasets but especially for those with an underlying static or dynamic relationship
as is often the case in any physical science experiment.

The following paper outlines the methodology of FoKL and includes two example problems.
- [Fast variable selection makes Karhunen-Lo√®ve
decomposed Gaussian process BSS-ANOVA a speedy
and accurate choice for dynamic systems
identification](docs/_static/arXiv.2205.13676v2.pdf)

The two example problems are:
- ‚ÄòSusceptible, Infected, Recovered‚Äô (SIR) toy problem
- ‚ÄòCascaded Tanks‚Äô experimental dataset for a benchmark

## Future Development

FoKL-GPy is actively in development. Current focus is on:
- Pyomo
- optimization of code and integration with faster C++ routines
- adding examples for better comparisons and benchmarks
- more robust tutorials

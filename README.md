## About FoKL

FoKL-GPy, or FoKL, is a Python package intended for use in machine learning. The name comes from a unique implementation 
of **Fo**rward variable selection using **K**arhunen-**L**o√®ve decomposed **G**aussian **P**rocesses (GP's) in 
**Py**thon (i.e., **FoKL-GPy**). 

The primary advantages of FoKL are:
- Fast inference on static and dynamic datasets using scalable GP regression
- Significant accuracy retained despite being fast

Some other advantages of FoKL include:
- Export modeled non-linear dynamics as a symbolic equation (i.e., use a GP model in Pyomo)
- Take first and second derivatives of model with respect to any input variable (e.g., gradient)
- User-friendly (e.g., automatic handling of various dataset formats, automatic creation of training set, etc.)
- Easy adjusting of hyperparameters for sweeping through variations in order to find optimal settings
- Ability to save, share, and load models
- Ability to import and evaluate a model without known data (i.e., without training)

To read more about FoKL, please see the [Benchmarks and Papers](#benchmarks-and-papers) section.

## Installation and Setup

From your command-line terminal, FoKL is available through PyPI:

```cmd
pip install FoKL
```

Alternatively, the GitHub repository may be cloned to create a local copy in which the examples and documentation will 
be included:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ESMS-Group-Public/FoKL-GPy
```

Once installed, import the FoKL module in Python with:
```python
from FoKL import FoKLRoutines
```

From here, the FoKL class object may be created and its methods accessed. Please see [Use Cases](#use-cases) to learn more about working with FoKL models.

## Use Cases

Please first refer to the following for tutorials and examples:
- [Training and/or evaluating a model](docs/tutorials/clean.py)
- [Saving and/or loading a model](docs/tutorials/save_and_load/save_and_load.py)
- [Validating model via plot and RMSE](examples/sigmoid/sigmoid.py)

### FoKLRoutines

The [FoKLRoutines](#foklroutines) module houses the primary routines for a FoKL model. Namely, these are the [load](#load) function and [FoKL](#fokl) class object.

#### load

```python
model = FoKLRoutines.load(filename, directory=None)
```

Load a FoKL class from a file.

By default, ```directory``` is the current working directory that contains the script calling this method. An absolute or 
relative directory may be defined if the model to load is located elsewhere.

For simplicity, enter the returned output from [save](#save) as the argument here, i.e., for ```filename```. Do this while 
leaving ```directory``` blank since ```filename``` can simply include the directory itself.

#### FoKL

```python
model = FoKLRoutines.FoKL(**kwargs)
```

This creates a class object that contains all information relevant to and defining a FoKL model.

Upon initialization, hyperparameters and some other settings are defined with default values as attributes of the FoKL 
class. These attributes are as follows, and any or all may be specified as a keyword or later updated by redefining the 
a class attribute.

Each method has optional inputs that allow for flexibility in how FoKL is used so that you may leverage these methods 
for your specific requirements. Please refer to the [Use Cases](#use-cases) first, then explore the following documentation of 
each method as needed.

##### clean

```python
model.clean(inputs, data=None, **kwargs)
```

For cleaning and formatting inputs prior to training a FoKL model. Note that data is not required but should be entered 
if available; otherwise, leave blank.

| Input        | Type | Description                                                                                                                          | Default    |
|--------------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| ```inputs``` | any  | $n \times m$ input matrix $\mathbf{x}$ of $n$ instances by $m$ features in model $\overline{y}=f(\overline{x}_1,...,\overline{x}_m)$ | n/a        |
| ```data```   | any  | $n \times 1$ output vector $\overline{y}$ of $n$ instances in model $\overline{y}=f(\overline{x}_1,...,\overline{x}_m)$              | ```None``` |

| Keyword             | Type    | Description                                         | Default    |
|---------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| ```bit```           | integer | (16, 32, 64) floating point bits to save dataset as | ```64```   |
| ```train```         | scalar  | (0,1] fraction of $n$ instances to use for training | ```1```    |
| ```AutoTranspose``` | boolean | assumes $n > m$ and transposes dataset accordingly  | ```True``` |

After calling [clean](#clean), the now normalized and formatted dataset gets saved as attributes of the FoKL class. Be sure to use these attributes in place of the originally entered ```inputs``` and ```data``` so that normalization and formatting errors are avoided. The attributes are as follows:

| Attribute             | Type                 | Description                                                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```model.inputs```    | $n \times m$ ndarray | normalized and formatted ```inputs```                                   |
| ```model.data```      | $n \times 1$ ndarray | formatted ```data```                                                    |                                                            |
| ```model.normalize``` | list of $m$ lists    | [min, max] factors used to normalize ```inputs``` to ```model.inputs``` |
| ```model.trainlog```  | $n \times 1$ ndarray | logical index of instances from dataset to use as training set          |

To then access the training set ```[traininputs, traindata]```, see [trainset](#trainset).

##### generate_trainlog

```python
model.trainlog = model.generate_trainlog(train, n=None)
```

Generate random logical vector of length $n$ with ```train``` percent as ```True```. It is expected that [generate_trainlog](#generate_trainlog) will be called internally by [clean](#clean) and not by the user, though this method is available if sweeping through values of ```train``` in order to compare the accuracy of models fitted to training sets of different sizes.

##### trainset

```python
traininputs, traindata = model.trainset()
```

Run this line to access the training set, which is simply ```model.inputs``` and ```model.data``` indexed by ```model.trainlog```. See [clean](#clean) for how ```model.inputs``` and ```model.data``` get defined and/or [generate_trainlog](#generate_trainlog) for how ```model.trainlog``` gets defined.

##### bss_derivatives

```python
dy = model.bss_derivatives(**kwargs)
```

For returning gradient of modeled function with respect to each, or specified, input variable.
If user overrides default settings, then 1st and 2nd partial derivatives can be returned for any variables.

| ```dy``` | $n \times m \times 2$ ndarray if ```ReturnFullArray=True```, else $n \times m_{\delta}$ where $m_{\delta}$ is the number of partial derivatives requested | derivative of model with respect to input variable(s) (i.e., state(s)) defined by ```d1``` and ```d2``` | gradient (i.e., $n \times m_{\delta}$ ndarray where $m_{\delta} =m$ because ```d1=True, d2=False``` |

Tip:
- To turn off all first-derivatives, set ```d1=False``` instead of ```d1=0```. The reason is ```d1``` and ```d2```, if set to an integer,
 will return the derivative with respect to the input variable indexed by that integer using Python indexing.
 In other words, for a two-input FoKL model, setting ```d1=1``` and ```d2=0``` will return the first-derivative with
 respect to the second input (```d1=1```) and the second-derivative with respect to the first input (```d2=0```).
 Alternatively, ```d1=[False, True]``` and ```d2=[True, False]``` will function the same so that boolean lists may be used in cases where the derivative with respect to more than one state, but not all states, is required.

##### evaluate_basis

```python
basis = model.evaluate_basis(c, x, kernel=None, d=0)
```

Evaluate a basis function at a single point by providing coefficients, $x$ value(s), and (optionally) the kernel. This method is primarily used internally by other methods and so is not expected to be used by the user, but is available for testing purposes and to provide insight toward how the basis functions get evaluated.

For evaluating a FoKL model, see [evaluate](#evaluate).

| Input   | Type            | Description                                                           |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```c``` | list of scalars | coefficients of the basis function or its derivative                                    |
| ```x``` | scalar          | value of independent variable at which to evaluate the basis function or its derivative |

| Keyword      | Type    | Description                                    | Default            |

|-------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| ```basis``` | scalar | evaluation of basis function or its derivative at ```x``` |

If insightful for understanding how to define ```c```, the values of ```kernel``` and order ```d``` correspond to the following equations at which ```basis``` is evaluated:

| Kernel                        | Order    | Basis Function $B_i$ or its Derivative </sup>                                                                                                                                        |

| ```'Bernoulli Polynomials'``` | ```d=0``` | $B_i=\sum_{k=0}^{i} (c_k \cdot x^k)\implies$ <pre>```c[0] + sum(c[k] * (x ** k) for k in range(1, len(c)))```</pre>                                      |
| "                             | ```d=1``` | $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(B_i)=\sum_{k=1}^{i} (k \cdot c_k \cdot x^{k-1})\implies$ <pre>```c[1] + sum(k * c[k] * (x ** (k - 1)) for k in range(2, len(c)))```</pre>                |
| "                             | ```d=2``` | $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(B_i)=\sum_{k=2}^{i} (k \cdot (k-1) \cdot c_k \cdot x^{k-2})\implies$ <pre>```sum((k - 1) * k * c[k] * (x ** (k - 2)) for k in range(2, len(c)))```</pre> |

When called internally by [evaluate](#evaluate), the coefficients ```c``` (i.e., $\overline{c}_i$) automatically correspond to $i$ such that $B_i=f(\overline{c}_i)$. For  ```'Cubic Splines'```, this is achieved by ```c = list(model.phis[i - 1][k][phind] for k in range(4))``` where ```phind``` $=f(x)$. For ```'Bernoulli Polynomials'```, this is achieved by ```c = model.phis[i - 1]```.

##### evaluate

```

| ```clean```        | boolean | pass ```inputs``` to [clean](#clean) if true; note this will override ```normalize``` and result in ```inputs``` scaled to 0-1 | ```False```       |
| ```ReturnBounds``` | boolean | return 95% confidence bounds as second output if true                                                                          | ```False```       |

If ```clean=True```, then any keywords documented for [clean](#clean) may be used here.

| ```mean```              | $n \times 1$ ndarray | prediction of $\overline{y}$ in $\overline{y}=f(\overline{x}_1,...,\overline{x}_m)$ for provided ```inputs```; prediction of ```model.data``` defined in [clean](#clean) by default (i.e., ```inputs=model.inputs```) |
| ```bounds``` (optional) | $n \times 2$ ndarray | upper and lower bounds for 95% confidence interval of predicting; returned if ```ReturnBounds=True```                                                                                                                 |

Note if attempting to automatically format ```inputs``` but normalize to different [min, max] values than those of ```inputs```, this will have to be done manually. A workaround to achieve this is as follows:

```python
# Un-normalized and un-formatted 'raw' input variables of dataset:
x = [x0, x1, ..., xM]

# Initialize FoKL class:
model = FoKLRoutines.FoKL(...)

# Automatically normalize and format:
model.clean(x)

# Normalized and formatted 'raw' input variables of dataset:
x = model.inputs

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Un-normalized and un-formatted 'other' input variables to evaluate:
u = [u0, u1, ..., uM]

# Initialize additional "throw-away" FoKL class in order to access clean without overriding attributes:
dummy = FoKLRoutines.FoKL(...)

# Automatically normalize and format:
dummy.clean(u)

# Normalized and formatted 'other' input variables to evaluate:
u = dummy.inputs

# Both x and u are normalized to 0-1 scales, but we need to re-scale u according to x:
u = u * (dummy.normalize[1] - dummy.normalize[0]) + dummy.normalize[0]  # scale of original u
u = (u - model.normalize[0]) / (model.normalize[1] - model.normalize[0])  # scale of normalized x

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Both x and u are on the same scale now, normalized according to x, and so long as u is contained within x's extrema:
mean = model.evaluate(u)
```

The following will *not* achieve the same result:
```
mean != model.evaluate(u, clean=True)
mean != model.evaluate(u, clean=True, normalize=model.normalize)
```

However, if attempting to *only* normalize ```inputs``` to different [min, max] values, implying the format of ```inputs``` matches exactly with the format of ```model.inputs``` returned by [clean](#clean) (that is, $n \times m$ ndarray), then the following will achieve the same result:
```
mean = model.evaluate(u, normalize=model.normalize)
```

##### coverage3

```python
mean, bounds, rmse = model.coverage3(**kwargs)
```

For validation testing of a FoKL model. Default functionality is to evaluate all inputs (i.e., train and test sets) using [evaluate](#evaluate).
Returned is the predicted output ```mean```, 95% confidence bounds ```bounds```, and Root Mean Square Error ```rmse```. A plot
may be returned by setting ```plot=True```; or, for a potentially more meaningful plot in terms of judging
accuracy, ```plot='sorted'``` will plot the data in increasing value.

| ```evs```   | ndarray                      | vector of BIC values corresponding to each proposed model during training                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

##### clear

```python
model.clear(keep=None, clear=None, all=False)
```

Delete all attributes from the FoKL class except for hyperparameters and settings, unless otherwise specified by the ```clear``` keyword.
If an attribute is listed in both the ```clear``` and ```keep``` keywords, then the attribute is cleared.

| Input       | Type            | Description                                                                                        | Default          |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| ```keep```  | list of strings | attributes to keep in addition to hyperparameters and settings, e.g., ```keep=['inputs', 'mtx']``` | ```model.keep``` |
| ```clear``` | list of strings | hyperparameters to delete, e.g., ```clear=['kernel', 'phis']```                                    | ```None```       |
| ```all```   | boolean         | if ```True``` then all attributes (including hyperparameters) get deleted regardless               | ```False```      |

Note when the FoKL class was initialized, ```model.keep``` got defined by default as a list of strings including the names of all hyperparameters and settings. These then get preserved here by default.

To remove all attributes from the class, simply call:
```python
model.clear(all=True)
```

##### to_pyomo

```python
m = model.to_pyomo(m=None, y=None, x=None, **kwargs)
```

Automatically convert ```draws``` from a FoKL model trained with or defined by the ```'Bernoulli Polynomials'``` kernel to symbolic expressions in a Pyomo model.

Defining the Pyomo model's objective and any other constraints must be done outside of the ```to_pyomo``` method.

The user must then define an appropriate solver for the Pyomo model. The following is known to work for global optimization problems, which will likely be required for a problem using a GP model.
```python
solver = pyo.SolverFactory('multistart')
solver.solve(m, solver='ipopt')
```  

##### save

```python
filepath = model.save(filename=None, directory=None)
```

Save a FoKL class as a file with extension '*.fokl*'.

Both inputs are optional. By default, ```filename``` is of the form '*model_yyyymmddhhmmss.fokl*' and is saved to the
current directory. To change the directory, embed within ```filename``` or assign to ```directory``` if using the default ```filename``` format.

Returned is ```filepath```. Enter this as the argument to [load](#foklroutinesload) to later reload the model. Explicitly, that is:
```python
FoKLRoutines.load(filepath)
```

| Input           | Type   | Description                                                                                        |
|-----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```filename```  | string | name of file to save model as (note '*.fokl*' extension can be automatically or manually appended) |
| ```directory``` | string | absolute or relative path to pre-existing folder in which to save ```filename```                   |

| Output         | Type   | Description                               |
|----------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| ```filepath``` | string | absolute path to where the file was saved |

### getKernels

*For internal use.*

This package is used by [FoKL](#fokl) during initialization to return the data structure ```phis```, containing coefficients for the basis functions specified by ```kernel```.
```python
import FoKL.getKernels
phis = getKernels.sp500()  # kernel == 'Cubic Splines'
phis = getKernels.bernoulli()  # kernel == 'Bernoulli Polynomials'
```

### GP_integrate

```python
from FoKL.GP_Integrate import GP_Integrate
T, Y = GP_Integrate(betas, matrix, b, norms, phis, start, stop, y0, h, used_inputs)
```

Integrate FoKL models of derivatives.

| ```stop```        | ```stop``` is the time to end integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ```y0```          | ```y0``` is an array of the inital conditions for the models being integrated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ```h```           | ```h``` is the step size with respect to time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ```used_inputs``` | ```used_inputs``` is a list of arrays containing the information as to what inputs are used in what model. Each array should contain a vector corresponding to a different model. Inputs should be referred to as those being integrated first, followed by those contained in ```b``` (in the same order as they appear in ```y0``` and ```b``` respectively).                                             |

| Output  | Description                                                                                          |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```T``` | ```T``` is an array of the time steps the models are integrated at.                                  |
| ```Y``` | ```Y``` is an array of the models that have been integrated, at the time steps contained in ```T```. |

For example, if two models were being integrated, with 3 other inputs total
and the 1st model used both models outputs as inputs and the 1st and 3rd additional
inputs, while the 2nd model used its own output as an input and the 2nd
and 3rd additional inputs,
```python
used_inputs = [[1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]]
```
If the models created do not follow this ordering scheme for their inputs,
the inputs can be rearranged based upon an alternate
numbering scheme provided to ```used_inputs```. E.g., if the inputs need to be reordered then the 1st input should have a '1' in its place in the
```used_inputs``` vector, the 2nd input should have a '2' and so on. Using the
same example as before, if the 1st models inputs needed rearranged so that
the 3rd additional input came first, followed by the two model outputs in
the same order as they are in ```y0```, and ends with the 1st additional input,
then the 1st cell in ```used_inputs``` would have the form ```[2, 3, 4, 0, 1]```.

## Benchmarks and Papers

As mentioned in [About FoKL](#about-fokl), the primary advantage offered by FoKL in comparison to other machine learning packages 
is a significant decrease in computation time for training a model while not experiencing a significant decrease in 
accuracy. This holds true for most datasets but especially for those with an underlying static or dynamic relationship
as is often the case in any physical science experiment.

The following paper outlines the methodology of FoKL and includes two example problems.
- [Fast variable selection makes Karhunen-Lo√®ve
decomposed Gaussian process BSS-ANOVA a speedy
and accurate choice for dynamic systems
identification](docs/_static/arXiv.2205.13676v2.pdf)

The two example problems are:
- ‚ÄòSusceptible, Infected, Recovered‚Äô (SIR) toy problem
- ‚ÄòCascaded Tanks‚Äô experimental dataset for a benchmark

## Future Development

FoKL-GPy is actively in development. Current focus is on:
- Pyomo
- optimization of code and integration with faster C++ routines
- adding examples for better comparisons and benchmarks
- more robust tutorials

[TUTORIAL]: self.save(self, filename=None, directory=None)
            FoKL.Routines.load(filename, directory=None)

This is a tutorial for the 'save' method, a useful feature that allows saving a FoKL model. This is most beneficial
after training a large model, as 'fit' takes the longest to process.

In this tutorial, the following will be demonstrated:
    1) Train a new FoKL model.
    2) Save the model.
    3) Load a model.

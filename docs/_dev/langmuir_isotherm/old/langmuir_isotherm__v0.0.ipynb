    "- under **Discussion of Results with Mica and Glass**, it seems the results were obtained without $\\sigma_1$ being known; it seems $\\theta_1$ was somehow measured\n",
    "    - sort of, achieved by $m x + b$ Equation 32 by measuring only $(p, q_{obs})$ where $q_{obs}$ is simply $C_0 - C_e \\equiv C_{initial} - C_{equilibrium}$\n",

    "\n",
    "Or, since previous work already results in $q_{cal} = f(p)$ at constant $T$, perhaps FoKL can provide $q_{cal} = f(T, p)$. In this case, simply training FoKL models $a = f(T)$ and $b = f(T)$ will allow $q_{cal} = f(T, p)$. However, it would be possible for this to result in negative values for $a$ and/or $b$ and thus $q$.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, to prevent negative values of $\\theta_1$ since $\\mathcal{F}_{GP}$ is not bounded to positive values, training directly on $a$ is not desired. Also, to enable higher accuracy, the definition of $\\mathcal{F}_{GP}$ was adjusted to avoid a nonlinear proportionality to its training input (i.e., $\\ln(T)$). Satisfying both these requirements,\n",
